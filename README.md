Ubuntu-In-A-Browser-App
-----------------

Explore and play around with Ubuntu in a browser!  I modified it so that it can be deployed in any cloud platform of your choice.  You will need root or ssh to be able to deploy this in a container.  Scalable and easy to maintain!

Playable demo at https://cg-term.arukascloud.io/ (Unfortunately Arukas has shut down, but you can still deploy this on any cloud platform)
